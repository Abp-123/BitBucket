Create a Simple Project Locally:
# Create project folder
mkdir MyBitbucketProject
cd MyBitbucketProject

# Create a README file
echo "Hello Bitbucket" > README.md

# Optional: create a simple code file
echo "print('Hello World')" > app.py

Initialize Git Repository:
git init
git status  # Check untracked files

Stage and Commit Files:
git add README.md app.py
git commit -m "Initial commit with README and app.py"

Push to Remote Repository on Bitbucket
Create a new repository on Bitbucket called MyBitbucketProject. don't include README.md as we are creating it manually
Add the remote and push:
git remote add origin https://<username>@bitbucket.org/<username>/MyBitbucketProject.git # BitBucket link
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


Create a New Branch:
git checkout -b feature-branch

Make Changes in the Feature Branch:
echo "This is a new feature" >> README.md
git status
git diff
git add README.md
git commit -m "Added new feature description"

Push Feature Branch to Bitbucket:
git push -u origin feature-branch

Merge Feature Branch into Main
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge feature branch:
git merge feature-branch


If there are conflicts, resolve them manually, then:

git add README.md
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"

Push Updated Main Branch
git push origin main
